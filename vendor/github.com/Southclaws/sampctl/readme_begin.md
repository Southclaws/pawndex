### SA:MP Server Configuration - no more `server.cfg`

Manage your server settings in JSON or YAML format

### Automatic Server Restart - no more dodgy bash scripts

Run the server from `sampctl` and let it worry about restarting in case of crashes.

## Overview

sampctl is designed for both development of gamemodes/libraries and management of live servers.

Below is a quick overview of the best features that will help _you_ develop faster.

### Package Management and Build Tool

If you've used platforms like NodeJS, Python, Go, Ruby, etc you know how useful tools like npm, pip, gem are.

It's about time Pawn had the same tool.

sampctl provides a simple and intuitive way to _declare_ what includes your project needs. After that you simply let sampctl take care of the downloading and building.

If you release scripts, you know it's awkward to test even simple code. You need to set up a server, compile the include into a gamemode, configure the server and run it.

Forget all that. Just make a `pawn.json` in your project directory with `sampctl package init` and use `sampctl package install` the includes you need:

```json
{
    "entry": "test.pwn",
    "output": "test.amx",
    "dependencies": ["Southclaws/samp-stdlib", "Southclaws/formatex"]
}
```

Write your quick test code:

```pawn
#include <a_samp>
#include <formatex>

main() {
    new str[128];
    formatex(str, sizeof str, "My favourite vehicle is: '%%v'!", 400); // should print "Landstalker"
    print(str);
}
```

And run it!

```bash
sampctl package run

Server Plugins
--------------
 Loaded 0 plugins.

Started server on port: 7777, with maxplayers: 50 lanmode is OFF.

Filterscripts
---------------
  Loaded 0 filterscripts.

My favourite vehicle is: 'Landstalker'!
```

You get the compiler output and the server output without ever needing to:

* visit sa-mp.com/download.php
* unzip a server package
* worry about Windows or Linux differences
* set up the Pawn compiler with your favourite editor
* make sure the Pawn compiler is reading the correct includes
* download the formatex include

### Server Configuration and Automatic Plugin Download

Use JSON or YAML to write your server config:

```json
{
    "gamemodes": ["rivershell"],
    "plugins": ["maddinat0r/sscanf"],
    "rcon_password": "test",
    "port": 8080
}
```

It compiles to this:

```conf
gamemode0 rivershell
plugins sscanf.so
rcon_password test
port 8080
(... and the rest of the settings which have default values)
```

What also happens here is `maddinat0r/sscanf` tells sampctl to automatically get the latest sscanf plugin and place the `.so` or `.dll` file into the `plugins/` directory.
